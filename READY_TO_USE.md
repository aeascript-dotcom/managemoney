## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS THE SIMULATOR REVEALS

1. **Debt Eats Salary** (30-40% typical)
   - Most of your salary is already spoken for

2. **Social Costs Are Real** (¥192,000/year)
   - Saving face in society is expensive

3. **Impatience Taxes You** (26% premium on credit)
   - Credit cards make items much more expensive

4. **Health = Money** (100-200% accident cost increase)
   - Poor sleep and diet multiply financial risk

5. **Survival Margin Thin** (1-2 accidents away from crisis)
   - Most salarymen are closer to financial disaster than they think

6. **Passion Budget Prevents Crisis** (¥10k/month saves ¥100k+)
   - Allocating for happiness prevents impulse disasters
